The StudentPortal project is a streamlined web application designed to efficiently manage student data using a single table for CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete). The project is built with the ASP.NET Core framework and utilizes Entity Framework Core (EF Core) as its ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) tool, allowing for automated database management and operations.

Key Features:
Single Table CRUD Operations:

The project provides a simple interface for performing CRUD operations on student records, including adding new students, updating existing details, viewing student lists, and deleting student records. This is designed for educational institutions or small applications needing basic student data management.
Entity Framework Core ORM:

The use of EF Core allows seamless integration between the application and the underlying database. Developers do not need to manually write complex SQL queries to interact with the database; EF Core handles these operations under the hood using the model classes. The application's database structure is modeled via code-first EF Core, meaning the table structure is defined by C# classes.
Automatic Database Creation:

One of the standout features of this project is its ability to automatically generate and maintain the database schema using EF Core migrations. This allows the application to automatically create a database during deployment, regardless of whether the database is hosted on local storage or in the cloud (Azure, AWS, etc.). EF Core ensures that the database is always in sync with the applicationâ€™s model, and migrations make it easy to apply any changes to the database structure as the application evolves.
Cloud and Local Storage Support:

The flexibility of EF Core allows the database to be hosted in both local environments and on cloud-based services, making this project scalable for various hosting scenarios. The application's connection string can be configured to point to a local SQL Server instance or a cloud-based database, and EF Core will handle the rest.
Minimalistic Design for Learning and Scaling:

This project is ideal for beginners looking to understand the core concepts of ASP.NET Core, EF Core, and database management. By focusing on a single table, it simplifies learning, while still demonstrating powerful ORM features like data querying, filtering, and updating. It can also serve as a foundation for more complex projects.
Use Cases:
Educational Institutions: This application can be used by schools or universities to manage basic student data.
Learning and Development: Perfect for developers seeking a starting point for learning EF Core and CRUD operations.
Cloud-Ready Applications: It demonstrates how applications can be built to work seamlessly both locally and in the cloud, making it a great example of modern web application development.
Technology Stack:
ASP.NET Core: The core framework for building the web application.
Entity Framework Core: For ORM and database operations.
SQL Server: Can be used as a local or cloud-hosted database (but can be configured for other databases as well).
Cloud Support: Built to easily integrate with cloud platforms like Azure or AWS for database hosting.
